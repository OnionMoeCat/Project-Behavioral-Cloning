## Project Description

In this project, I use a neural network to clone car driving behavior.

Those images were taken from three different camera angles (from the center, the left and the right of the car).  

The network is based on [The NVIDIA model](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/), which has been proven to work in this problem domain.

As image processing is involved, the model is using convolutional layers for automated feature engineering.  

### Files included

- `model.py` The script used to create and train the model.
- `drive.py` The script to drive the car. You can feel free to resubmit the original `drive.py` or make modifications and submit your modified version.
- `utils.py` The script to provide useful functionalities (i.e. image preprocessing and augumentation)
- `model.h5` The model weights.

Note: I updated drive.py to preprocess the camera image to fit the model input shape. This is because the model input shape is different from image size.

## Quick Start

### Run the pretrained model

Start up [the Udacity self-driving simulator], choose a scene and press the Autonomous Mode button.  Then, run the model as follows:

```python
python drive.py model.h5
```

### To train the model

You'll need the data folder which contains the training images.

```python
python model.py
```

This will generate a file `model-<epoch>.h5` whenever the performance in the epoch is better than the previous best.  For example, the first epoch will generate a file called `model-001.h5`.

## Model Architecture Design

The design of the network is based on [the NVIDIA model](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/), which has been used by NVIDIA for the end-to-end self driving test.  As such, it is well suited for the project.  

It is a deep convolution network which works well with supervised image classification / regression problems.  As the NVIDIA model is well documented, I was able to focus how to adjust the training images to produce the best result with some adjustments to the model to avoid overfitting and adding non-linearity to improve the prediction.

I've added the following adjustments to the model. 

- I used Lambda layer to normalized input images to avoid saturation and make gradients work better.
- I've added an additional dropout layer to avoid overfitting after the convolution layers.
- I've also included ELU for activation function for every layer except for the output layer to introduce non-linearity.

In the end, the model looks like as follows:

- Image normalization
- Convolution: 5x5, filter: 24, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 5x5, filter: 36, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 5x5, filter: 48, strides: 2x2, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
- Convolution: 3x3, filter: 64, strides: 1x1, activation: ELU
- Drop out (0.5)
- Fully connected: neurons: 100, activation: ELU
- Fully connected: neurons:  50, activation: ELU
- Fully connected: neurons:  10, activation: ELU
- Fully connected: neurons:   1 (output)

As per the NVIDIA model, the convolution layers are meant to handle feature engineering and the fully connected layer for predicting the steering angle.  However, as stated in the NVIDIA document, it is not clear where to draw such a clear distinction.  Overall, the model is very functional to clone the given steering behavior.  

The below is a model structure output from the Keras which gives more details on the shapes and the number of parameters.

## Image Augumentation

For training, I used the following augumentation technique along with Python generator to generate unlimited number of images:

- Randomly choose right, left or center images.
- For left image, steering angle is adjusted by +0.2
- For right image, steering angle is adjusted by -0.2
- Randomly flip image left/right
- Randomly translate image horizontally with steering angle adjustment (0.002 per pixel shift)
- Randomly translate image vertically
- Randomly added shadows
- Randomly altering image brightness (lighter or darker)

Using the left/right images is useful to train the recovery driving scenario.  The horizontal translation is useful for difficult curve handling (i.e. the one after the bridge).

### Examples of Augmented Images

The following is the example transformations:

**Center Image**

![Center Image](images/center.png)

**Flipped Image**

![Flipped Image](images/flip.png)

**Translated Image**

![Translated Image](images/trans.png)

## Data Preprocessing
The purpose of Data Preprocessing is to fit the augmented pictures into the model. Preprocessing happens after augmentation. It chops irrelevant part of the picture, resize the picture for model, and normalize the image data for better result.

- the images are cropped so that the model won’t be trained with the sky and the car front parts
- the images are resized to 66x200 (3 YUV channels) as per NVIDIA model
- the images are normalized (image data divided by 127.5 and subtracted 1.0).  As stated in the Model Architecture section, this is to avoid saturation and make gradients work better)

## Model Training

### Training, Validation and Test

I splitted the images into train and validation set in order to measure the performance at every epoch.  Testing was done using the simulator.

As for training, 

- I used mean squared error for the loss function to measure how close the model predicts to the given steering angle for each image.
- I used Adam optimizer for optimization with learning rate of 1.0e-4 which is smaller than the default of 1.0e-3.  The default value was too big and made the validation loss stop improving too soon.
- I used ModelCheckpoint from Keras to save the model for every epoch.

### The Lake Side Track

The batch size is chosen as 256 since it is a reasonable power of 2 number. As there can be unlimited number of images augmented, I set the steps per epoch to 3125 (each epoch learns 3125 * 256 = 800k samples).  I found 2 epochs is good enough (really!) to produce a well trained model for the lake side track.

### The Jungle Track

Unfortunately, I did not have much GPU time to train a model with additional data collected from Jungle Track. So I run the Jungle track with the model for the Lake Track. Apparently the model is not good enough, and the car is stuck to the border of the road.

## Outcome

The model can drive the course without bumping into the side ways.
